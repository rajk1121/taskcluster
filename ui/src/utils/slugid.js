 * slug will begin with [A-Za-f]. For example such slugs don't require special
 * handling when used as command line parameters (whereas non-nice slugs may
 * start with `-` which can confuse command line tools).
 *
 * Potentially other "nice" properties may be added in future to further
 * restrict the range of potential uuids that may be generated.
